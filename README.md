## [GPT Messenger](https://messenger-asnbmtgsh-ravi-asthanas-projects.vercel.app/)


### Getting started
1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm` && `nvm install 18` (The project runs on node >= 18)
2. Clone the repo.
3. Then `cd gpt-messenger`
4. Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
5. Once the installation is done, run `yarn env:gen` to generate a `.env.local` file
6. Add your environment variables to each available key
7. Now run `yarn dev` to run the project
8. The app will be deployed to port 3000 and will be available on `localhost:3000`

### Wait
There is more.
Apart from running the code, you can also contribute by improving it!
I will be adding a guide here soon!

Thanks n Happy Coding!
